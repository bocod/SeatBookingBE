# SeatBooking

[See the app in action!](https://seatbooking-49893.web.app)

This backend repository works together with it's frontend.

[By clicking here you can take a look to the frontend...](https://github.com/bocod/SeatBooking)

This app main objective is to choose a movie, select a seat and see the total price to pay.

This is posible, thanks to the use of reactHooks working all along and across the app.

By the other hand, the frontend wouldn't do anything if it weren't thanks to node and express.

Hope you like it!
